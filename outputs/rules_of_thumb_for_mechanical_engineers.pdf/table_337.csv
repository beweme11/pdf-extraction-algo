"is about = 0.3 PO, implying that initial yield occurs when 0.3po = k or po = 3.3k where k is the yield stress in shear. However, it can be shown that for po < 4k, elastic shakedown is reached so that subsurface plastic deformaÃ¼on does not continue throughout life. Recalling that the max to ",imum contact pressure with the square root of load makes this shakedown effect very important. More details on the concept of residual stress to induced shakedown and additional effects that can lead to shakedown such as hardening can be found in Johnson [10].
