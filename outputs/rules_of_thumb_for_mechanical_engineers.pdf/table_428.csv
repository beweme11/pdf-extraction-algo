"The design of rotating disks and shafts can present a design challenge, particularly when high rotaüonal speeds are coupled with significant transmitted torque, large number of start to stop cycles, desire for lightweight design, and elevated temperature operation. The mechanical stresses in the hoop and radial directions are a function of the square of the angular velocity (o). A 10% increase in the rotaüonal","speed will increase the su•ess level by 21%. Thermal gradients in turbine disks have a significant impact on the total   range experienced in the disk and will have a big effect on the low cycle life of the disk. Where interference fits known as radial pilots are required between shafting components, the intemal or external p:essure loads should be included in the calculation of peak sÜesses."
