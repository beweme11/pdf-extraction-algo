Balanced Seals,,
"It is apparent from our discussion of unbalanced seal designs that the primary purpose of a balanced seal is to reduce the hydraulic closing force acting on the seal face, and therefore provide a seal design suitable for high to pressure applications. For pusher seals, the primary trait of a balanced seal design is the seal faces dropping below the balance diameter, as shown in Figure 13. The shaft or sleeve now has a stepped diameter which allows the seal face dimensions to be reduced. This reduction now exposes more of the front side of the rotating seal face to the seal chamber pressure. Because pressure acts in all directions, this increased exposure opposes or negates a larger portion of the pressure and effectively reduces the closing force acting on the seal face. This reduction of the closing force allows for the maintenance of a good lubrication film between the seal faces at pressures as high as 1,500 psig for a single pusher seal.","While ical step design stepped
