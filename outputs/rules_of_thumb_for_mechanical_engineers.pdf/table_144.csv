"Piping Considerations

Integral pumping features are, by their design, very in to  • Minimize number of fitdngs used. Eliminate elbows efficient flow devices. Consequently, the layout of the seal and tees where possible, using long radius bent pipe as piping can have a great impact on performance. The fol to  a replacement.
lowing are some general rules for the piping: • Wha•e possible, uülize piping that is one size larger than the seal chamber pipe connections.
Slope the piping a minimum of h"" per foot, and eliminate any areas where a vapor pocket could form.
