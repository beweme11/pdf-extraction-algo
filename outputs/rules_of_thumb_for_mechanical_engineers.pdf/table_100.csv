Work,
"Work may be done by (WouD or on (Win) a system. In thermodynamics, we are more interested in work done by a system Wout, considered positive, which causes the energy of the system to reduce. Work is a path func√ºon. Since it does not depend on the state of the system or of the sub to ","stance, it is not a property of the system. In a p to v diagram, work is the following integral:"
Heat,
"Heat is the thermal energy transferred because of temperature difference. It is considered positive if it is added to the system, that is, Qin. A unit of heat is the same as energy, that is, ft.lbf; but a more popular format is Btu:
1Btu = 778.17/ft.1bf = 252/ca10ries = 1,055/Jou1es","Like work, it is a path function, and not a property of the system. If there is no heat transferred between the system and the surroundings, the process is called adiabatic."
