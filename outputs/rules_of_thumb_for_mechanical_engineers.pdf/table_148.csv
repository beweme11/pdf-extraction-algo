"Pumps fall into two distinct categories: dynamic pumps and positive displacement pumps.
Dynamic pumps are of two types: cenffifugal and axial. They are characterized by the way in which energy is converted from the high liquid velocity at the inlet into pressure head in a diffusing flow passage. Dynamic pumps have a lower efficiency than positive displacement pumps. But their advantages lie in the output of relatively high flow rates compared to their sizes, and their low maintenance costs. They also operate at relatively higher speeds.
Positive displacement pumps are of several types, including reciprocating, rotary screw, and gear pumps. These","pumps operate by forcing a fixed volume of fluid from the inlet pressure section to the discharge section of the pump. In reciprocating pumps, this is done intermittently; and in others this is done continuously. These types of pumps are physically larger than the dynamic pumps for comparable capacity, and they operate at relatively lower speeds.
Table 1 shows major pump types, their characteristics, and their applications.
