"Creep is plastic  which increases over üme under sustained loading at generally elevated temperatures. Stress rupture is the continuaüon of creep to the point where failure takes place. Metallic and nonmetallic materials vary in their susceptibility to creep, but most common structural materials exhibit creep at s&ess levels below the propor   limit at elevated temperatures which exceed onethird to one to half of the melting temperature. A few metals, such as lead and tin, will creep at ordinary temperatures.
The typical strain to time diagram in Figure 39 for a material subject to creep illusü•ates the three stages of creep behavior. After the iniüal elasüc deformation, the material exhibits a relatively short period of primary creep (stage 1), where the plastic sfrain rises rapidly at first. Then the strain versus time curve flattens out. The flatter portion of the curve is referred to as the secondary or steady state creep (stage 2). This is the stage of most importance to the en to ","gineer in the design process. The final or tertia.ry creep stage (stage 3) is characterized by an acceleration of the creep rate, which leads to rupture in a relatively short period of time.
High sü•esses and high temperatures have comparable effects. Quantitatively, as a function of temperature, a logarithmic relationship exists between süess and the creep rate. A number of empirical procedures are available to correlate stress, temperature, and üme for creep in commercial alloys. The Larson to Miller parameter (KLM) is an example of one of these procedures. The general form of the Larson to Miller equaüon is:

T = temperature in OF. t = time (hours) c = empirical parameter relating test specimens to design component"
