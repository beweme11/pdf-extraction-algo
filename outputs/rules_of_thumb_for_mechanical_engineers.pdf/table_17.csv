Bulk Modulus,
"A liquid's compressibility is measured in terms of its bulk modulus of elasticity. Compressibility is the percentage change in unit volume per unit change in pressure:
öv/v öp","The bulk modulus of elasticity K is its reciprocal:
K is expressed in units of pressure."
Compressibility,
"Compressibility of liquids is defined above. However, for a gas, the application of pressure can have a much greater effect on the gas volume. The general relationship is governed by the perfect gas law:","where p is the absolute pressure, vs is the specific volume, R is the gas constant, and T is the absolute temperature."
