Single Outside Seals,
"While single outside seals (Figure 17) are not the arrangement of choice, certain situations dictate their usage. Equipment with a very limited seal chamber area is a good candidate for an outside seal. Economics will also impact the use of a single outside seal. To prevent the need for very expensive metallurgies in highly corrosive applications, outside seals are sometimes employed. Because all the metal parts are on the atmospheric side of the seal, only the seal faces and secondary sealing members are exposed to the corrosive product. If outside seals must be used, always use a balanced seal design.",Figure 17. Single outside seal. (Courtesy of Durametallic Corp.)
