Losses In Pipe Fittings and Valves,,,
"In addition to losses due to friction in a piping system, there are also losses associated with flow through valves and fittings. These are called minor losses, but must be accounted for if the system has a lot of such fittings. These are freated as equivalent frictional losses. The minor loss may be freated either as a pressure drop Ap = —KpV2/2 or as a head loss Ah = —KV2/(2g). The value of the loss coefficient K is obtained through experimental data. For valves and fittings, manufacturers provide this value. It may also be calculated from the equivalent length concept: K = fLJD, where Le is the equivalent pipe length that has the same frictional loss. Table 3 gives these values for some common fittings,","Table 3
