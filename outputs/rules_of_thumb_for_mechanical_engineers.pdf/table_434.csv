"' If the case moment at the junction of the flange and the case is not significant, then the minimum bolt load at operaüng condiüons can be calculated using Figure 37. The mating flanges should remain in contact at points A and D. As long as the preload FD on the inner contact land D exceeds the case load (F ), the bending moment is dependent upon FD . First calculate the required preload FD to prevent separation at D.
FD = Fcase(c/b)
