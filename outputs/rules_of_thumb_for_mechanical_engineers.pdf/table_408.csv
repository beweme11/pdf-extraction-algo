"or complex parts. It may require several intermediate dies and heat ü•eatments to produce very complex pa.rts. Rolling is used to produce flat plate, strip, and foil. Wire drawing, as the name implies, is used for wires. Tubes can also be drawn by including a plug in the die set to up. Exü•usions are made of low melting point alloys, aluminum, copper, and lead because of the high forces needed to push the metal through the die and the high temperatures required to decrease the material strength. Deep drawing is used to form thin sections like doorknobs and beverage cans.
