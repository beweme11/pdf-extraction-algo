Radial Ball and Roller Bearings of Tolerance Classes ABEC to I, RBEC to I

Dimensions in inches
Tolerance Classificaticns shown are for solid steel shaft. Numerical values are listed in Table 15. For hollow or nonferrous shafts, tighter fits may be needed.
If greater accuracy is needed, substitute 15, k5 and m5 for 16, k6, and m6 respectively.
