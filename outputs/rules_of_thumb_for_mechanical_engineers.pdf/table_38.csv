"FLUID MEASUREMENTS
Total energy in a fluid flow consists of pressure head, ve to 	The gravitational head is negligible; hence, if we know two locity head, and potential head:	of the three remaining variables (H, p, and V), we can find the other. In addition to the above, flow measurement also involves flow discharge, turbulence, and viscosity. p 2g
