Recirculation,
A recirculation problem is just the opposite of a cavita√ºon problem. Cavitation occurs when a pump is forced to operate at a flow rate higher than the intended rate. But if the pump is operated at a rate considerably lower than the,"one it was designed for, this causes recirculation. It results in noise and vibration because the fluid energy is reduced through fluid shear and internal friction."
