Motors: Useful Equations,
"The following equations are useful in determining the current, voltage, horsepower, torque, and power factor for AC motors:
Full Load 1 =  E (eff.) PF
(three phase)
= (eff.) PF]
(single phase) kVA input =IE  (three phase) = IE/I,OOO (single phase) kW input =kVA input (PF) hp output = kW input (eff.)/0.746 = Torque (rpm)/5,250
Full Load Torque = hp (5,250 lb. to ft.)/rpm
Power Factor = kW input/kVA input","where
E = Volts (line to to to line)
I = Current (amps)
PF = Power factor (per unit = percent PF/IOO) eff = Efficiency (per unit = percent eff./100) hp = Horsepower kW = Kilowatts kVA Kilovoltamperes
