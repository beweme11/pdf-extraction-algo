Themodynamic Temperature Scale,
"If we run a Carnot cycle engi.ne between the temperatures corresponding to boiling water and melting ice, it can be shown that the efficiency of such an engine will be 26.8%. Although water is used as an example, the effciency of such an engine is actually independent of the working fluid","used in the cycle. Because = 1 â€” (Q/QH), the value of QL/QH is 0.732. This sets up both our Kelvin and Rankine scales once we establish the differential. In Kelvin scale, it is 100 degrees; in Rankine scale, it is 180 degrees."
