"Fatigue is dealt with in different ways, depending on the application:
Infinite life design
Safe life design
Fail safe design
Damage tolerant design
In Wohler's original work on railroad axles, he noted that there is a st to ess below which failure will not occur. This stress level is referred to as the fatigue strength or endurance limit. The simplest and most conservative design approach is to keep the stress below this level and is called infinite life design. For some applications, the cycles accumulate so rapidly that this is virtually the only approach. A gear tooth undergoes one cycle each time it meshes with another gear. If the gear rotates at 4,000 rpm, each tooth will experience nearly a quarter cycles during every hour of operation. Vibratory stresses must also be kept below the endurance limit, since these cycles mount up even faster. This type of loading is referred to as high cyclefatigue, or HCF. The term low cyclefatigue, or LCF, is used to describe applications in which the load is applied more slowly, such as in steam turbines. One cycle is applied when the engine is started and stopped, and the engine may run continuously for months at a time.
In the aerospace business, the excessive weight required to design for infinite life is prohibitive. With the safe life design approach, a life is calculated which will cause a small","percentage of the parts (typically I out of 10,000) to initiate a crack. All parts are removed from service when they reach the desiY1 life, even though the vast majority show no evidence of cracking. approach has been used in the aircraft and turbine engine industries. When the design life is calculated, the analysis must account for significant scatter in the applied loads and fatigue properties of the materials.
In some instances, design precautions can be taken such that the failure of a particular component will not be catasuâ€¢ophic. This is known asfail safe design. After failure, the component can be replaced. This often involves redundant systems and multiple load paths. An obvious example of this approach is a multi to engine plane. If one engine fails, the others can still provide power to keep the plane flying. In the design of the aircraft and engine, it is necessary to ensure that debris from the failure of one engine will not take out vital systems. In one airline accident, fragments from a turbine wheel burst in one engine knocked out all three hydraulic systems which were placed closely together at one point along the fuselage.
Damage tolerant design assumes that newly manufactured parts may have cracks already in them. The design life is based on the crack growth life of the largest crack that may escape detection during inspection. This approach has been championed by the U.S. Air Force for many years. It puts a greater emphasis on the crack growth properties of the material, while the safe life approach emphasizes the crack initiation properties. It also requires good inspection capability."
