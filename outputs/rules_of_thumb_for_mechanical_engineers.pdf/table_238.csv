"implies an operating internal clearance of zero. Because this is not a normally recommended situation, the a3 factor for load zone is almost always less than 1.0. ms type of calculation is usually done in a computer progam and combined with all the other applicaüon factors. For hand calculations, it is best to ignore this portion of the factor as it is often balanced out by other factors also not used in hand calculaüons. To a certain extent, this factor has been accounted for in the life equation since it was partly derived from empirical data involving bearings running with some clearance.
Misalignment in excess of the above limits will always result in an a3 factor less than 1.0. This is also a factor best","Figure 10. Life adjustment factor as function of lubricant film parameter [12]. (Reprinted Wiffl permission ofASME.)
left to computer programs. However, Figure 11 for ball bearings under radial load illustrates the importance of maintaining good alignment in all situations.
It must be emphasized that care be taken in the use of the three life adjustment factors. A considerable amount of information must be kiown to use them properly, and often some of the needed information is not available. It is also improper to use one of the adjustment factors to compensate for something like contamination."
