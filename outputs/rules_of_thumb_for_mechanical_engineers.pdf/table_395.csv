Element Amount	Effect,Element Amount	Effect,Element Amount	Effect
Balance Fe—Best oxidation and hot corrosion,Balance Fe—Best oxidation and hot corrosion,Balance Fe—Best oxidation and hot corrosion
"co, Ni",,"resistance, low temperature limitations Ni—Excellent high temperature oxidation resistance
Co to —Best hot corrosion resistance, not as good in high temperatRE oxidation
Ni + Co to — to Best balance between oxidaton and hot corrosion, mixed environments"
Cr,16 to 25,"Mainly hot corrosion resistance, synergistc effect with for oxidation"
Al,6—12,Oxidation 	although excess additions cause embrittlement
,0.3 to 1.0,Improved oxide adhesion by tying up S in alloy Hot corrosion
"T4 Pt,Pd",,Oxidation
