"FORMING
Metals can be shaped by a number of processes which include machining and plastic deformadon. This secdon will briefly address metal shaping by plastic deformaüon. Plastic deformaüon is the application of force to change the shape of a material. Some of the more common types of
strength with a resultant in as shown schematically in Figure 24. When used hot, these processes can close off porosity from the casting stage."
