Superposition,
"The principle of superposition states that the stresses at a point in a body that are caused by different loads may be calculated independently and then added together, as long as the sum of the stresses remains below the proportional",limit and remains stable. Application of this principle allows the engineer to break a more complex problem down into a number of fundamental load the solutions of which can be found in many engineering handbooks.
