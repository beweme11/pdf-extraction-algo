"Surface temperature measurement can be somewhat easier than fluid temperature measurement due to fewer configuration error sources. Radiation effects can, to a large extent, be ignored, as a sensor placed on a surface will see the same radiative flux as the surface beneath it would if the sensor were not present. The only exception to this would occur in high radiative flux environments where the sen to ","fluid and surface. Sensors that are of minimal cross to section or are embedded into the surface of interest minimize velocity errors. Embedding is preferred over surface mounting because of the superior heat transfer to the sensor along the increased surface area of the groove (see Figure 4).
