Type,Major Characteristics,Application
"Shell and tube
Air cooled heat exchangers
Double pipe
Extended surface
Brazed plate fin
Spiral wound
Scraped surface
Bayonet tube
Falling film coolers 
Worm coolers
Barometric condenser
Cascade coolers
Impervious graphite","Bundle of tubes encased in a cylindrical shell Rectangular tube bundles mounted on frame, with air used as the cooling medium
Pipe within a pipe; inner pipe may be finned or plain
Externally finned tube
Series of plates separated by corrugated fins
Spirally wound tube coils within a shell Pipe within a pipe, with rotating blades scraping the inside wall of the inner pipe
Tube element consists of an outer and inner tube
Vertical units using a thin film of water in tubes
Pipe coils submerged in a box of water
Direct contact of water and vapor
Cooling water flows over series of tubes
Constructed of graphite for corrosion protection","Always the first type of exchanger to consider Economic where cost of cooling water is high
For small units
Services where dle outside tube resistance is appreciably greater than the inside resistance. Also used in debottlenecking existing units
Cryogenic services: all fluids must be clean
Cryogenic services: fluids must be clean
Crystallization cooling applications
Useful for high temperature difference between shell and tube fluids
Special cooling applications
Emergency cooling
Where mutual solubilities of water and process fluid permit
Special cooling applications for very corrosive process fluids
Used in very highly corrosive heat exchange services"
