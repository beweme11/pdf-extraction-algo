"CRACK PROPAGATION ANALYSIS
Most of the crack growth analysis that is commonly performed in industry is based on linear elasticfracture mechanics a to EFM). As a general rule, LEFM is considered to be valid as long as the plastic zone in front of the crack is less than ho the crack lengül. This is adequate for most analyses since components with large amounts of cyclic yielding do not have enough life for practical applications. Mode 1 Bode 11 111 Elasüc to plastic fracture mechanics is quite complex, and is

There are three modes of crack propagation (Figure 11):"
