Cast iron is a higher carbon containing iron to based alloy. Cast irons contain more than 2.1 % C by weight. 'Ihey can be cast with a number of different microsüuctures. The most common is gray cast iron which has graphite flakes in a continuous three to dimensional structure which looks rather like potato chips. This structure promotes acoustic damping and low wear rates because of the graphite.,"A second süucwre involves heat to treadng the gray cast iron to form spherodized cast iron. In this strucmre, the damping capacity is lost but the corrosion resistance is improved.
White iron is very brittle and is formed during cool to down from the melt. It can be used as a wear to resistant surface if the rest of the casting can be ductilized by perhaps forming gray cast iron."
