"There are several stationary seal components that have close diametrical clearances to the shaft, such as the throttle bushing. For this reason, it is important for the seal chamber to be concentric with the pump shaft. Addidonally, for gland ring designs with O.D. pilots, the outer register must also be concenü•ic. To measure, install the dial indicators as shown in Figure 31. The indicator movement should not exceed 0.005"" TIR [l].
