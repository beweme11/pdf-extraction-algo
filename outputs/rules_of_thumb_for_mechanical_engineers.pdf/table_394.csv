Diffusion Coatings,Overlay Coatings
"Metallurgically reacts with base metal.
May detrimentally affect propaties, especially fatigue.
Approximately 50% of thickness is added.
Intemal coatngs possible by some methods.
Limits on compositions.","Thin metallurgical interaction.
All thickness is added.
Little effect on mechanical properies, although they increase cross to secion without increasing load capabilities.
Line of sight limitations make complex geometries difficult to coat.
Internal coatings not possible. Compositions by PVD, TS, Pa, HVOF neady unlimited."
