Surface Tension,
"Near the free surface of a liquid, because the cohesive force between the liquid molecules is much greater than that between an air molecule and a liquid molecule, there is a resultant force acting towards the interior of the liquid. This force, called the surface tension, is proportional to the","product of a surface tension coeffcient and the length of the free surface. This is what forms a water droplet or a mercury globule. It decreases with increase in temperature, and depends on the contacting gas at the free surface."
