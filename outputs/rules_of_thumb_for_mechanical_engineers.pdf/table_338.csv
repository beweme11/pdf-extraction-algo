"The discussion of surface roughness and the techniques used to quantify it are discussed here. Some general work in this area includes Thomas [15] and Greenwood [6].
'Ihe length scale of interest is smaller than that consid to ","mechanical properties also different near the surface than they are in the bulk of the material.
