"the smooth and rough surface contacts, and yield and plastic flow beneath the surface is not strongly dependent on the surface roughness. ms conclusion is the reason that many hertzian contact designs are based on calculated smooth surface pressure disüibuüons with an accompanying call to out on surface roughness.","Posidon along surface, Wa
