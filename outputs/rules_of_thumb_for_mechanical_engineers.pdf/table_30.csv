Pipes In Series,
"Pipes connected in tandem can be solved by a method of equivalent lengths. This procedure lets us replace a series pipe system by a single pipeline having the same discharge and the same total head loss. As an example, if we have two pipes in series and if we select the first sec√ºon as reference, then the equivalent length of the second pipe is obtained by:","5
1.42 (21)
'Ihe values offl and f2 are approximated by selecting a discharge within the range intended for the two pipes."
