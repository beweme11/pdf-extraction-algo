"Ceramics are generally brittle materials that have excellent compressive sü•ength. The tensile strength is dictated by the presence of surface flaws (griffith cracks). The surface flaws are generated by the fabricaüon methods and sequent machining operations.
There are two major types of ceramics: traditional and advanced. Traditional ceramics include refractory bricks, tableware, earthenware, whiteware, and common glass products. The advanced ceramics consist of both oxides and nonoxides. These ceramics may be used as structural ceramics and other technically advanced products. Some advanced ceramics and applications are listed in Table 21.
Ceramics can be formed by slip casting and powder metallurgical processes. Complex parts, like automotive turbochargers, can be formed by injection molding. Other methods include hot pressing and simple press and sinter operations. Often, the densification of the part is enhanced by adding lower melting compounds to the mixture prior to forming it. Yttrium oxide is a common addition to silicon nitride and silicon carbide to enhance the diffusivity.
Ceramics and glasses can be joined to metals, each other, and glasses. The joining technologies are just emerging for the most advanced materials. There are many physical","Table 21

properties that must be accounted for in selecting a joint combination. The two most significant are chemical compatibility and thermal expansion compatibility.
Ceramics can also be joined in the green state. This can greatly simplify the materials required to form the s&ucture."
