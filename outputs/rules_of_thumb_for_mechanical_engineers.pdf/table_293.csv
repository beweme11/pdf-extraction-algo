"Esdmate the rectifier Oe required for an infinite line. Refer to Figure l. If coaüng conductance tes6 have not been performed, pick a value from 'Ihble l.
Typical Wues of Coating Conductance","UE a value of — 0.3 volts for AEx. Ibis is usually enough to raise the potential of coated steel to about — 0.85 volb.
Use a value of 1.5 volb for AE at the drain point. HW values may be used in some ci.rcumstances; however, there may be a risk of some coating disbondment at higher voltagæ.
Calculate I at the drain point."
